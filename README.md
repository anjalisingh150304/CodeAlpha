 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains three end-to-end machine learning projects that predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Breast Cancer, and Heart Disease using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The goal is not just to build accurate models but also to explain predictions using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

 Projects Included
Diabetes Prediction – Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Breast Cancer Prediction – Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Heart Disease Prediction – Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset

Each project is implemented as a separate Jupyter Notebook and can be explored individually.

 Features
Data Preprocessing:

Missing value handling

Outlier treatment

Feature scaling and encoding

Model Training:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more

Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

Visualizations:

Correlation heatmaps

Feature importance graphs

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots

Explainable AI:

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand how features influence predictions

Example Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap

SHAP Summary Plot

 Installation

jupyter notebook
Run the cells step-by-step to train the models and visualize the results.

 Results
Achieved 76%+ accuracy on the Diabetes dataset

Achieved 94%+ accuracy on the Breast Cancer dataset

Achieved 85%+ accuracy on the Heart Disease dataset

These results may vary based on the chosen model and hyperparameters.
